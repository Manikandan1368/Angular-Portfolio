                <!-- <p class="default-p">My interest in software development started back in 2023 when I had to capture, clean, and 
                    analyze thousands of data points for my Master's Thesis in International Political Economy. Solving problems 
                    through code introduced me to the world of <span class="default-highlight">programming</span>, 
                    <span class="default-highlight">logic</span>, and <span class="default-highlight">automation</span>. 
                    The following year, I returned to college to study computer science and landed my 
                    <span class="default-highlight">first job in the tech industry</span>.

                    I've had the chance to work with a range of <span class="default-highlight">technologies</span> and developed valuable

                    team dynamics and organizational culture within a tech company. My technical knowledge has expanded 
                    through hands-on collaboration with developers and rigorous study of documentation. Over time, I've gained experience 
                    with programming logic, refined software craftsmanship, contributed to the development of 
                    <span class="default-highlight">websites</span> and built <span class="default-highlight">REST APIs</span>, 
                    collaborated on building visual dashboards, <span class="default-highlight">scrapers</span>, 
                    <span class="default-highlight">crawlers</span>, and participated in retrieving and processing data

                    and <span class="default-highlight">ArgoCD</span>. I've also been part of efforts to develop and maintain asynchronous systems

                    I have been involved in creating and managing <span class="default-highlight">PostgreSQL</span> 
                    databases, working on stream processing, and data pipelines. My work also involved handling secure authentication 
                    with <span class="default-highlight">OAuth2.0</span> and <span class="default-highlight">JWT</span>, 
                    as well as conducting User Acceptance Testing (UATs), performing manual testing, and writing user manual guides with  
                    <span class="default-highlight">LaTeX</span>. Furthermore, I developed end-to-end tests with

                    I have to tell you — I know you probably hear this a lot from other developers, but this much is true: 
                    my passion for technology goes far beyond work — <span class="default-highlight">I <em>am</em></span> 
                    the kind of person who finds joy in <span class="default-highlight">debugging tricky issues</span> 
                    and learning the intricacies of new frameworks just for fun. It's one of the reasons I pursued a 
                    Master's Degree — driven by sheer curiosity to <span class="default-highlight">turn the unknown into the known</span>.
                    I enjoy diving into documentation, 
                    exploring innovative solutions, and <span class="default-highlight">sharing knowledge</span> with my peers. 
                    Whether setting up a personal project to experiment with the latest tech stack or collaborating on a 
                    challenging problem, I'm motivated by curiosity and the thrill of continuous learning. This mindset fuels 
                    my technical growth and, I believe, helps contribute to a positive, dynamic team culture.
